One day, I was at the schloss at the top of the hill for some doener.
I was parched looking for something to drink when I stumbled upon the biergarten.
After the biergarten I jumped into my Porsche, but was safe by driving like a Schildkrote.
Then a driver in a BMW started to get wettbeswerbsfaehig and wanted to race to the nearby Schloss.
So I told him "Whoever wins will have to get Bratwurst for all the people in Hauptstrasse"
Then we will head over to the Flughafen in Rammstein.
